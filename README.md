## How this Website is working.
>In this Website you can make your user profile and search for movies. After searching for a movie name, the website will suggest you some similar movies which might have the same name. All of these data are from a REST API and API source is [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). After choosing each movie you can see the details of the movie and make it as your favorit movie and add comments. There is a link in the navigation bar to show you all of your favorite list, you can find it as My List.

> The Website has different modes, if you are a guest you have the least accessibility to the website. You can search for movies and see the details of the movie also other user's comments.

> As a normal user, you have all of the guest accessibility, also you can add a movie to your favorite list and add comment. 

> Admin has all of the above features, also it can remove users and their comments.
